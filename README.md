- Solution :

When you enter the website you will see this page

As you can see it states that your user agent is wrong and you can't access the site.
Something looks weird right? there is an html comment `Sup3rS3cr3tUserAgent`, Lets try this string as user-agent.

Response :

so the response from the server after adding the `Sup3rS3cr3tUserAgent` as the user agent now we got the second response which
says that the website only accept requests that are coming from this site: `s3cr3tsite.com` there is a hint to use a `Referer Header` 

so after adding the referer with this value : s3cr3tsite.com , we will get the flag
